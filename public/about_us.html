            <h2>Founding</h2>
            <p>SWOARN was founded when several activists came together to realize that we needed a centralized and efficient way of doing activism in the southwestern ohio area. We started from a scattered bunch of individual activists and formed a cohesive entity to help facilitate activism with all people who wish to participate in activism in the area.</p>

            <h2>Organization</h2>
            <p>SWOARN is a non-profit network of people who speak out against injustice and fight for animal rights. Anybody can participate in SWOARN activities, with the only precursor being a feeling of compassion and empathy for all sentient beings and a desire to effect change on how we treat others who may not look or sound the same as we do.</p>
