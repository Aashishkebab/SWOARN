            <h2>Founding</h2>
            <p>SWOARN was founded when several activists came together to realize that we needed a centralized and efficient way of doing activism in the southwestern ohio area. We started from a scattered bunch of individual activists and formed a cohesive entity to help facilitate activism with all people who wish to participate in activism in the area.</p>

            <h2>Organization</h2>
            <p>SWOARN is a non-profit network of people who speak out against injustice and fight for animal rights. Anybody can participate in SWOARN activities, with the only precursor being a feeling of compassion and empathy for all sentient beings and a desire to effect change on how we treat others who may not look or sound the same as we do.</p>

                    <h3>Pamela Snow</h3>
                    <p>Pamela spent the previous 26 years of her in and around the Air Force in various capacities, a life chosen from circumstances. From the beginning, her life was filled with many adversities. Because of this, she has always been able to see the very dark realities of humanity, which led her to the existential questions that ultimately brought about her humility.</p>
                    <p>Along this journey she began to question how humans regarded nonhuman animals as nothing more than lives for the taking and for exploiting. She sees this as one of many human ethical flaws. If it is wrong to inflict pain on a human being, it is just as wrong to inflict pain on an animal. Moreover, the lives of all animals, great and small, have value and are worthy of respect and compassion. Today she spends her time as an animal liberation activist.</p>
