            <h2>Boots on the ground</h2>
            <p>Our most common activism involves direct interaction with people when protesting or hosting demonstrations in public spaces. Talking to people directly allows us to have productive, meaningful discussion and encourage people to think critically about their choices and their role in animal suffering. There are several effective approaches to street activism.</p>

                    <h3>Anonymous for the Voiceless</h3>
                    <p>Anonymous for the Voiceless activism is a specific demonstration-style activism involving the showcase of animal agriculture on TVs and outreachers to engage those interested in the footage. AV is unique in their approach, using anonymous face masks to ensure the focus is kept on the TVS, and a usage of black clothing to prevent distractions. These demonstrations are called Cubes of Truth, and we participate in these all over the state.</p>
