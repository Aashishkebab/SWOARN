        <span class="text-section">
            <h2>Street Activism</h2>
            <p>Our most common activism involves direct interaction with people when protesting or hosting demonstrations in public spaces. Talking to people directly allows us to have productive, meaningful discussion and encourage people to think critically about their choices and their role in animal suffering. There are several effective approaches to street activism.</p>

                    <h3>Grassroots protests</h3>
                    <p>The heart of activism is the people. Much of our activism goes under no official name, style, or banner, but is simply a combined effort of us all to fight for the animals. Where there is animal abuse, so are we.</p>

                    <h3>Anonymous for the Voiceless</h3>
                    <p>Anonymous for the Voiceless activism is a specific demonstration-style activism involving the showcase of animal agriculture on TVs and outreachers to engage those interested in the footage. AV is unique in their approach, using anonymous face masks to ensure the focus is kept on the TVS, and a usage of black clothing to prevent distractions. These demonstrations are called Cubes of Truth, and we participate in these all over the state.</p>

                    <h3>Animal Activism Mentorship</h3>
                    <p>Animal Activism Mentorship's (AAM) mission is to educate and inspire our fellow humans to take action and equip them with what they need to fight for animal liberation. When someone is compelled to start their activism journey, they often don't know where to begin. AAM is here to encourage them, guide them, and lay a strong foundation on which their activism will stand for years to come.</p>
                    <p>AAM provides access to resources, knowledge, community support, and a launchpad for those who want to go to work for our nonhuman neighbors. AAM believes that by providing free and accessible education, one-on-one mentorship, and in-person events, it can create a powerful and effective community of animal activists who will work together to create lasting change for animals.</p>

                    <h3>Ohio Occurrence</h3>
                    <p>Ohio Occurrence is a multi-day animal activism event that tours the cities of Ohio. Founded by an AAM mentor after attending an AAM live tour in GA, she wanted to bring that energy to Ohio.</p>
                    <p>At Ohio Occurrence, volunteers advocate for suffering animals in several different industries through outreach, demos, protests…etc. This allows the volunteers to gain different experiences and to learn from seasoned activists. They can then take what they learn and use in their communities to advocate for animals.</p>
                    <p>If you have any questions you can email ohiooccurrence@gmail.com or how us on FB & IG for updates.</p>

            <h2>Institutional Change</h2>
            <p>While we can't immediately change the entire agricultural industry, we do work with local business owners and government officials to commit to transitioning to a plant-based system. Petitions are a great way to garner attention for a specific issues, and is one of many methodologies we use to effect change.</p>
