            <h2>Dairy</h2>
            <p>In order to produce milk, dairy cows are forcefully impregnated (aka raped). Once they give birth, their babies are stolen and put into solitary confinement (or killed if male) and the cows are milked until they are exhausted, at which point they are slaughtered.</p>

            <h2>Eggs</h2>
            <p>Egg-laying hens are some of the most mistreated creatures on our planet. They are stuffed into tiny battery cages, where they have about the size of a letter sheet of paper to move. They undergo forced molting (starvation) to force their bodies to produce more eggs. Moreover, all male chicks are ground up alive at birth, as they serve no use.</p>

            <h2>Meat</h2>
            <p>It is a violation of fundamental rights to kill someone who doesn't want nor need to die. In addition, animals raised for their flesh face immeasurable cruelty and suffering during the process, and 99% of farming in the US is considered intensive "factory" farming.</p>
            <p>Pigs routinely have pieces of their body cut off, are confined into farrowing crates so small that they can't turn around, and are eventually killed in gas chambers. Chickens are bred to be so large that they collapse under their own weight. Cattle are branded and have their horns cut off and bolted in the head in their last moments.</p>
            <p>In all instances, no matter how the animal is treated before slaughter, it is clear at the slaughterhouse that they don't want to be there, that they want to live, as they make every effort to escape their premature death.</p>

            <h2>Fish</h2>
            <p>In addition to the disastrous ecological impact of the fishing industries, we kill nearly two <b>trillion</b> fish every year. <a href="https://www.fishforward.eu/en/project/by-catch/" target="_blank">About 40% of this is by-catch</a>, fish that are not even the intended species. Fish are suffocated alive, and the oceans are destroyed in the process.</p>

            <h2>Horses</h2>
            <p>Horses are routinely used in entertainment, both for carriage rides and as race horses. Once race horses are done, they are frequently killed in slaughterhouses. Carriage horses are frequently mistreated and forced to walk while in pain. This is animal slavery, as they do not give consent.</p>

            <h2>Fur</h2>
            <p>Fur farming is an incredibly cruel practice that involves trapping or breeding small animals to skin them and wear them. 12 animals can go into making a single fur coat.</p>
