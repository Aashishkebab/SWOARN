            <h2>Who we are and what we do</h2>
            <p>We are a network of animal rights activists in the Cincinnati/Dayton area that work with organizations such as Animal Activism Mentorship, Anonymous for the Voiceless, Plant Based Treaty, Project Animal Freedom, Slaughter Free Network, PETA, and more to end all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty.</p>
            <p>We participate in many forms of activism. Anybody can organize an event, we make sure that compassion is at the forefront of everything we do and stand for.</p>

            <h2>Why activism is so important</h2>
            <p>Every day, billions of animals are abused and mistreated. Pigs are gassed, chicks are ground up alive, and animals are confined and exploited. We believe this is wrong.</p>
            <p>Animals are sentient. They feel pain, they suffer, and they are individuals that each have a unique subjective experience. It is a moral imperative that we end animal cruelty to the greatest extent possible, or at the very least not be the cause of it.</p>
